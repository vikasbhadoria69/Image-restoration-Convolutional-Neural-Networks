# Image restoration by using Convolutional Neural Networks 
* Used different techniques for adding noise to the image and using OpenCV library to reduce the brightness so as to create a perfect dataset of distorted image.
* Used the vgg19 CNN model as a part of transfer learning technique to see how effective CNN is to extract the original content from a distorted image.
* Built my own CNN model and trained it on a huge dataset to efficiently restore distorted images.
