Image restoration using CNN. 
The in detail project report is given here and can be studied in the pdf above.
The basic idea is to restore the content of an image with noise and captured in low light intensity, using CNN. 
The theory and outputs can be seen in the project report. 
There are total 3 code blocks. One is for adding noise to image. Second is the observations made by using Vgg19.
Third the the final code which includes model building and training. Final output predictions can be seen in this code.
